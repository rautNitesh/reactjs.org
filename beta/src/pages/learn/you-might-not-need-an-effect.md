title: 'You Might Not Need an Effect'
---

<Intro>

Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you "step outside" of React and synchronize your components with some external system like a non-React widget, network, or the browser DOM. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component's state when some props or state change), you shouldn't need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.

## How to remove unnecessary Effects {/*how-to-remove-unnecessary-effects*/}

To remove unnecessary Effects, follow these three steps:

1. **Calculate as much as you can during rendering.** It is a common mistake to write Effects that don't do anything other than updating a state variable in response to another state or a prop changing. This is very inefficient: React has just finished rendering, but an Effect updated the state and restarted the [rendering process](/learn/render-and-commit) from scratch. If you need to calculate something based on props and state, try to do it during rendering instead.
2. **Move interaction-specific logic into event handlers.** Every interaction begins with an event. In the event handler, you know exactly what happened. By the time an Effect runs, you don't know *what* the user did (for example, which button was clicked). This is why you'll usually handle interactions in the event handlers.
3. **Keep synchronization logic in Effects, if there is any.** Some logic needs to run *because* the component was rendered. For example, you might keep a non-React widget synchronized with the React state, or keep the React state synchronized with information from the network. In both of these cases, it doesn't matter which interaction caused the state to change. It only matters that the component needs to *remain synchronized* with some external system while it's on the screen. This kind of [synchronization logic](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events) should remain in Effects.

Sometimes, this may feel more like art than science. The examples below will help you develop the right intuition.

### Updating the state based on other state {/*updating-the-state-based-on-other-state*/}

Suppose you have a component with two state variables: `firstName` and `lastName`. You want to calculate a `fullName` from them by concatenating them. Moreover, you'd like `fullName` to update whenever `firstName` or `lastName` change. Your first instinct might be to add a `fullName` state variable and update it in an effect:

```js {5-9}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  // 🔴 Bad: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);
```

This is more complicated than necessary. It is inefficient too: it does an entire render pass with a stale value for `fullName`, then immediately re-renders with the updated value. Remove both the state variable and the Effect:

```js {5-6}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
```

**When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, [don't put it in state.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state) Instead, calculate it during rendering.** This makes your code faster (you avoid the extra "cascading" updates), simpler (you remove some code), and less error-prone (you avoid bugs caused by different state variables getting out of sync with each other). If this approach feels new to you, [Thinking in React](/learn/thinking-in-react#step-3-find-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state) has some guidance on what should go into state.

### Caching expensive calculations {/*caching-expensive-calculations*/}

This component computes `visibleTodos` by taking the `todos` it receives by props and filtering them according to the `filter` prop. You might feel tempted to store the result in a state variable and update it in an Effect:

```js {4-8}
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');

  // 🔴 Bad: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    setVisibleTodos(getFilteredTodos(todos, filter));
  }, [todos, filter]);
```

Like in the earlier example, this is both unnecessary and inefficient. First, remove the state and the Effect:

```js {4-5}
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');

  // ✅ This is fine if getFilteredTodos() is not slow.
  const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
```

In many cases, this code is fine! But maybe `getFilteredTodos()` is slow or you have a lot of `todos`. In that case you don't want to recalculate `getFilteredTodos()` if some unrelated state variable like `newTodo` has changed.

You can cache (or ["memoize"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)) an expensive calculation by wrapping it [`useMemo`](/apis/usememo) Hook:

```js {6-9}
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');

  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
    // ✅ Does not re-run unless todos or filter change
    return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
  }, [todos, filter]);
```

Or, written as a single line:

```js {6-7}
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');

  // ✅ Does not re-run getFilteredTodos() unless todos or filter change
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => getFilteredTodos(todos, filter), [todos, filter]);
```

**This tells React that you don't want the inner function to re-run unless either `todos` or `filter` have changed.** React will remember the return value of `getFilteredTodos()` during the initial render. During the next renders, it will check if `todos` or `filter` are different. If they're the same as last time, `useMemo` will return the last result it has stored. But if they are different, React will call the wrapped function again (and store _that_ result instead).

The function you wrap in [`useMemo`](/apis/usememo) runs during rendering, so this only works for [pure calculations](/learn/keeping-components-pure).

<DeepDive title="How to tell if a calculation is expensive?">

In general, unless you're creating or looping over thousands of objects, it's probably not expensive. If you want to get more confidence, you can add a console log to measure the time spent in a piece of code:

```js {1,3}
console.time('filter array');
const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
console.timeEnd('filter array');
```

Perform the interaction you're measuring (for example, typing into the input). You will then see logs like `filter array: 0.15ms` in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, `5ms` or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in `useMemo` to verify whether the total logged time has significantly decreased:

```js
console.time('filter array');
const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
  return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter); // Skipped if todos and filter haven't changed
}, [todos, filter]);
console.timeEnd('filter array');
```

Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users' so it's a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a [CPU Throttling](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-61/#throttling) option for this.

Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when [Strict Mode](/apis/strictmode) is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have.
